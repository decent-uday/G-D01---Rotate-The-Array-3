# G-D01---Rotate-The-Array-3
CCC_Hacker rank solution
Given an array of integers of size n, rotate it's elements towards right K times.

Note: One rotation of the array (a0, a1, a2... an-1, an) results into (an, a1, a2...., an-2, an-1).

Explanation for a Sample i/o

Sample Input: 5 1 3 5 7 9 3

Sample Output: 5 7 9 1 3

Explanation: We have to perform 3 rotations : 1st rotation : 9 1 3 5 7 2nd rotation : 7 9 1 3 5 3rd rotation : 5 7 9 1 3

Input Format

First line contains an integer n. Second line contains n integers, denoting the array a[n]. Third line contains one integer k, the number of times the array is to be rotated.

Constraints

1 <= n <= 1000

Output Format

Output n integers, denoting the array a[n] after rotation.
